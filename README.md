## What is  Credit Card Fraud?

The act of  illegally deceiving a person to optain their money using their payment card.


## Aim of the Project
-	Aim of the project is to build a classifier that can detect card fraudulent transactions


- Using Machine-Learning techniques to detectcard fraudulent transactions





## Approach Used To build Credit Card Fraud Detection Model

1. Data Exploaration
  - using R functions such as head() and tail() to examine the credit card dataframe 
  
2.  Data Manupulation
  - Using the scale() function in R to the amount column in the dataframe
 
3. Data Modelling
  - Dataframe will be standardized before spliting the data by 0.80 to test and training dataframes
  
4.  Fitting a Logical Regrettion Model
 
5.  Fitting a Decision Tree Model

6. Artificial Neural Network

7.  Gradient Boosting (GBM)
